# NetAutoSys with Ansible

## üåê About The Project
This repository contains the implementation of automated DMVPN (Dynamic Multipoint Virtual Private Network) deployment using Ansible. Developed as part of a Master's thesis at Kigali Independent University, this project aims to simplify network management across multi-vendor environments, enhancing efficiency and reducing errors through automation.

### üõ† Built With
- **Ansible**: Used for automating network configuration and management tasks.
- **GNS3**: Employed for creating a realistic network simulation environment.
- **Ubuntu**: Operating system of choice for hosting the Ansible controller.

## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

- **Ansible**
  ```sh
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install ansible
  ```
